# Decisions

Business, product, and process context that doesn't belong in `plan.md`
(technical design) — the reasoning behind naming, scope, and process
calls that a future session (or future you) would otherwise have to
reconstruct from chat history that's already gone.

## Naming

"Kaazap" is "Pazaak" spelled backwards.

## Purpose and bar for quality

This is a personal project, but the intent is for it to eventually be
presentable enough to share (portfolio piece, itch.io release). That
raises the bar somewhat versus a pure hobby throwaway: worth caring about
things like a real README, no crashes/panics in normal play, and
documenting platform-specific build requirements (e.g. ALSA dev libs on
Linux once sound lands) — without turning this into a project that needs
enterprise-grade process for a solo effort.

## Rule variants (intentional deviations from real Pazaak)

- **Main deck draws 0–10, not 1–10.** Real Pazaak's main deck only goes
  1–10; Kaazap's includes 0. This was set intentionally during earlier
  development — the original reasoning wasn't written down and isn't
  currently recalled, but it's deliberate, not a bug. Kept as-is; treat
  it as one of Kaazap's subtle rule changes rather than something to
  "fix" without a real design conversation first.
- **No per-turn side-card limit.** Real Pazaak allows exactly one
  side-deck card per turn; Kaazap allows any number in a turn,
  including chaining several recovery cards while over 20. Deliberate
  simplicity (no per-turn flag to track) — confirmed as a variant, not
  canon fidelity, during spec 001's review.
- **The draw key accepts the bust while over 20.** Going over 20
  doesn't bust by itself (that part is canon — you may play a card to
  recover before your turn ends); Kaazap's variant is that while over,
  `d` draws nothing and instead stands into the bust, same as `s`, so
  the draw key keeps a meaning in that state. Human-ruled during spec 001
  (T008b). (Spec 006 made Space "play the selected card" rather than
  draw, so `d`/`s` are the bust-accepting keys now — Space isn't.)
- **Flip/bust edge rulings** (canon sources are thin here, spec 001):
  a *standing* player pushed over 20 by a flip card busts immediately;
  a *live* player pushed over gets their recovery window; any side
  still over 20 when the round ends for another reason is bust at
  resolution; and if both sides end up bust, the round is a tie.
- **Table cap of 12, filling it holds (not "filled table wins").** Each
  side's table holds at most 12 cards per round (dealer draws + played,
  combined). Real Pazaak caps at 9 and a side that *fills* the table
  without busting wins the round outright; Kaazap uses 12 and filling it
  simply **auto-stands** you on your current total (which then wins,
  loses, or ties by the normal rules). Deliberately simpler for now — it
  reuses the existing stand/resolve path instead of adding a special
  win condition. The over-20 recovery window still applies while a slot
  remains (an 11-card side over 20 can play its 12th as a recovery).
  Human-ruled for spec 003; revisit the canonical "fill wins" as a
  possible post-v1 variant.

## Why a campaign/progression system exists at all

In KOTOR, Pazaak's minus and special side-deck cards are gated by the
game's larger economy — you buy better cards from vendors using credits
earned across the whole RPG. Kaazap has no surrounding RPG to supply that
context. Rather than just handing the player every card type for free
from the start, Kaazap introduces its own lightweight progression:
currency and/or card packs earned from match wins, unlocking better cards
over a campaign of increasingly difficult opponents. This is what gives
the "distinct opponents," "full save/resume," and "card variety" pieces
of the project a shared reason to exist together, rather than being three
unrelated features.

## Explicitly deferred out of v1

- **Full side-deck customization** (building/collecting your own 10-card
  deck between matches, KOTOR-vendor style). v1 ships a simple default
  deck instead. Revisit once the campaign loop itself is proven out.
- **Mid-run side-deck redraw.** Real Pazaak doesn't redraw your hand
  within a given match, and v1 of Kaazap won't either. Deferred rather
  than rejected: once the full game exists, rule enhancements that fit
  the TUI format get considered as a deliberate post-v1 pass (see
  `ROADMAP.md`), and a redraw mechanic is a candidate there.

## Audio & music (spec 004)

- **No copyrighted Star Wars / KOTOR music, even 8-bit covers.** The
  Cantina Band theme and the KOTOR Pazaak music are copyrighted
  (Lucasfilm/Disney and John Williams; BioWare/LucasArts), and a fan
  chiptune *cover* of them is still a derivative work — not licensable for
  a project meant to be shared. Attribution is not a license: only a
  license grants the right to use, and none exists for fan use. So Kaazap
  ships none of it.
- **Bundled track is CC-BY, credited.** v1 ships Kevin MacLeod's "Chipper
  Doodle" (CC-BY 4.0) as the background loop — properly licensed for reuse
  with attribution (`assets/CREDITS.md`). It's a placeholder: the target
  vibe (the *Star Wars* cantina-jazz feel, evoked not copied) isn't well
  matched by anything in the CC0/CC-BY libraries surveyed, so generating
  an original is roadmapped (see `ROADMAP.md`).
- **Sound effects are generated, not sourced.** All SFX are synthesized by
  `scripts/gen_sfx.py` (square/triangle blips), so they carry no
  third-party licensing.

## Testing

No tests exist in the codebase as of the project's pickup (last commit
Jan 2026). Going forward, game logic gets unit test coverage as it's
written or touched — not retroactively applied to every existing line on
day one, but treated as real discipline from here on, not aspirational.
